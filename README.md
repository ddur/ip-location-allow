# ip-location-allow

This is (will be soon ðŸ˜Ž) a Plugin Extension for ["IP Location Block" WordPress plugin](https://github.com/gdarko/ip-location-block), selective allowing administrators by dynamic/static DNS domain, country, intenet provider or IP 

Code already exists for at least 5 years, but was never published on [GitHub](https://github.com/ddur/WordPress-IP-Geo-Allow/).
Plugin was made to extend the abandoned [IP Geo Block - WordPress plugin](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block).

Now it has to be renewed/converted as extension for ["IP Location Block" WordPress plugin](https://github.com/gdarko/ip-location-block) and checked for compatibilities with most recent WordPress and PHP versions.

If you are interested to be notified when changes occur, please show your interest by giving a "star" or click "watch" for this repository (see at the top-right of this GitHub repository page).

Thanks.
