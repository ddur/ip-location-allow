Code already exists at least 5 years for [IP Geo Block - WordPress plugin](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block) but has to be renewed/converted for ["IP Location Block" WordPress plugin](https://github.com/gdarko/ip-location-block) and checked for compatibilities with most recent WordPress and PHP versions.
